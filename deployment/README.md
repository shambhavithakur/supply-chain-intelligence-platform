# Deployment Configuration

Supply Chain Intelligence Platform deployment options and enterprise configurations.

## Local Development

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/shambhavithakur/supply-chain-intelligence-platform.git
cd supply-chain-intelligence-platform

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Add your actual API keys to .env

# Test framework modules
python src/supplier_risk_analysis/main.py
python src/inventory_intelligence/main.py
python src/logistics_optimization/main.py
python src/disruption_prediction/main.py
python src/demand_forecasting/main.py
```

## Google Cloud Platform

### Cloud Run Deployment
- Serverless scaling for supply chain analysis API endpoints
- Automatic scaling based on analysis request volume
- Integrated with Google Cloud Storage for data persistence
- Support for scheduled supply chain monitoring reports

### BigQuery Integration
- Data warehousing for historical supply chain analysis
- SQL-based querying for complex supplier intelligence
- Integration with Google Data Studio for executive dashboards
- Automated data pipeline for continuous supply chain monitoring

## AWS Deployment

### Lambda Functions
- Event-driven supply chain monitoring
- Cost-effective for periodic risk assessments
- Integration with S3 for historical data storage
- CloudWatch monitoring for framework health

### EC2 Instances
- Full control over supply chain analysis environment
- Suitable for continuous supplier monitoring systems
- Custom security configurations for enterprise data
- Direct database connectivity for real-time analysis

## Docker Containerization

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.12-slim

WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

COPY src/ ./src/
COPY .env.example .env

EXPOSE 5000
CMD ["python", "-m", "flask", "run", "--host=0.0.0.0"]
```

## Environment Configuration

### Required Environment Variables
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`: Claude API access for supply chain analysis
- `CONTACT_EMAIL`: Business contact information
- `SUPPLIER_HEALTH_THRESHOLD`: Risk scoring threshold
- `FORECAST_HORIZON_MONTHS`: Demand forecasting period

### Optional Configuration
- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection for data persistence
- `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT`: GCP project ID for cloud services
- `API_REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE`: Rate limiting configuration

## Security Considerations

### API Key Management
- Store API keys in secure environment variables
- Use cloud secret management services
- Rotate API keys regularly following security best practices
- Never commit API keys to version control

### Data Protection
- Implement proper access controls for supply chain data
- Use HTTPS for all API communications
- Encrypt sensitive supplier and inventory data at rest
- Comply with data retention and privacy policies

## Monitoring & Logging

### Framework Monitoring
- Request/response logging for analysis endpoints
- Performance metrics for supply chain analysis speed
- Error tracking and alerting for system failures
- Usage analytics for business intelligence insights

### Business Metrics
- Analysis request volume and patterns
- Framework accuracy tracking for supplier predictions
- Cost optimization measurement and ROI tracking
- Client satisfaction and framework performance metrics
